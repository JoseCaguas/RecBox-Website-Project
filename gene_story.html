        <h2>Gene's Story</h2>
        <h3>Written by Tina Antonucci</h3></p>


        <div>

            <p>I was asked by a friend to help her father, Gene who was suffering from undiagnosed cognitive decline/
                Dementia. The Home he was at was becoming frustrated with him because they stated that dad was
                “difficult.”
                I met Gene after agreeing to spend an entire day with him to see what was going on. When I arrived at
                the
                Nursing home the nurse advised me that Gene was a fall risk and at times could be “difficult.” She
                stated
                that usually they had no issues with him during the day but he becomes restless in the late afternoons
                and
                evenings. When I arrived at 9am Gene was taking a post breakfast nap. Since I was observing I let him
                sleep
                and I let the staff do their job. Gene slept until 11am and then got ready for lunch. At lunch we did
                share
                conversations. Although Gene is not fully comprehendible we were able to hold small conversations about
                his
                boat, and what was on the menu for lunch. After lunch I did bring a few different activities to see what
                Gene might enjoy. I also wanted to evaluate his skills. This would enable me to plan for our next
                scheduled
                visit. Before visiting with Gene I met with his daughter who shared some important information about
                Gene
                with me. Gene owned his own construction business, it was his pride and joy. Besides that he loved
                playing
                poker but was not able to play any more due to cognitive decline.</p>

            <p>The first activity I created was a cognitive stimulating game using recycled cards and some poster board.
                I placed different poker hands on the poster board and asked Gene to name the hands. I wrote the name of
                the hand on the back so whoever is playing with him can see if he got the hand correct. Gene loved this
                game! While he was no longer able to play poker, he was able to play this modified version and he did
                recognize the hands. He stared at each hand for a moment before stating the answer. He scored 98% the
                first
                time playing this game and he was fully engaged. After a day of observation, talking with his aides and
                the
                staff at the nursing home I agreed with his daughter and the staff that Gene could be suffering from
                sundowning. Sundowning is a behavior associated with Alzheimer’s patients that can cause agitation,
                aggression, increased confusion, restlessness, etc., from the late afternoon into the evening. Some of
                the
                reasons linked to the cause include emotional exhaustion, stress due to cognitive loss, and sleep
                disturbances.</p>

            <p>For my next visit I planned out our day from morning to bedtime. I also created some more personal
                stimulating activities that I thought Gene would enjoy. As I arrived for my second visit with Gene
                around
                at 9am Gene had again eaten breakfast and was fast asleep. This time I woke Gene at 9:30 and gave him a
                snack and a drink and we did some stretching and morning stimulation. I made new cards for Gene to play
                with harder hands, this time putting two hands on a board and having Gene tell me which hand beats the
                other. This was a bit harder for him, although again he got 98% he took much longer answering the double
                hands and seemed to really be playing the game in his head. The second activity I created for Gene was a
                sensory construction reminiscing board. I used some recycled hardware parts and instructions on how to
                install a sliding door. Gene ran his fingers over the parts that were glued to the board. He was able to
                tell me what each part was and what its function was. Gene even stared at the instructions carefully
                taking
                it all in. He commented that aluminum is what he would use. He looked around the room and asked where we
                were installing the sliding glass doors. I asked Gene where he thought they should go. After carefully
                inspecting every corner of the room Gene pointed to the big window that looked out to the patio. He said
                “right there”, and I agreed.</p>

                            My client loved this board. He sat for over twenty minutes focused on the pieces, telling me
                            in detail what each tool was used for. His daughter stated that this was the first time she
                            saw her dad positively engaged and verbally appropriate.

            <p>The next activity we started was something that I planned on continuing in the evening as a soothing
                before bed activity. I gave Gene a plane kit to work on. This was not expensive, I actually picked this
                kit
                up at the dollar store. I thought it would be something he would enjoy as his daughter mentioned he
                worked
                on planes while serving in the Air Force in his younger years. Gene loved it. He enjoyed looking over
                the
                instructions and while he needed assistance putting the pieces together he really was fully engaged.
                Gene
                was happy, his body language was calm and relaxed and although we modified the activity we focused on
                the
                skills Gene did have and had much success. While Gene read out the instructions I helped glue the right
                pieces together as he had a hard time grabbing some of the smaller pieces. We took turns holding the
                glued
                pieces in place before we could fully let go and let it dry. While the glue was drying different pieces
                in
                place we did other activities to keep him stimulated. We then went to lunch and after lunch we read
                about
                Navy planes in a book I got at the library. As Gene was in the Air-Force I thought he would enjoy
                reminiscing about planes while we were working on a plane.</p>

            <p>In the evening before bed we decided to paint the plane that was now completely dry. After looking at all
                the Navy books it was no surprise that Gene wanted to paint it blue! This was a great soothing activity
                that completed the day’s activities. It left Gene with a sense of accomplishment as well as modifying
                some
                of the negative behaviors that are associated with Alzheimer and Dementia patients.

            <h3>Gene was not “difficult.”</h3></p>

            <h2>Observation</h2>

            <p>Gene needed to be stimulated, and he needed to be treated with dignity and respect. Using his personal
                interests I created activities that were specific to his personal needs. Wouldn’t it be nice if when we
                age
                someone treats us like this? Gene attending Bingo each day when it was an activity he never really
                enjoyed
                or attended before. So instead of understanding Gene and creating an environment for success the staff
                labeled him “difficult” because he was anxious and exit-seeking in the evening due to lack of proper
                stimulation.</p>

            <p>Taking the time to get to know Gene and learn about his personal likes and interests, learning about his
                life and routines, those are tools that can assist in providing quality of life to people like Gene
                living
                with this disease.</p>

            <p>I am still working with Gene and having much success. I share Gene’s story to inspire caregivers and
                anyone
                in this field to think outside the box. Use a person’s life history as a tool to help improve their
                quality
                of life. Understand that when the person living with this disease displays these “difficult” behaviors
                they
                are often trying to tell us something that they can no longer communicate. That is when we have to put
                on
                our investigator hats and try to figure out what’s going on and provide the support and care they really
                need.</p>

            <p>One size or activity does not fit all and that is where Recbox can help. Providing you the tools and
                support to customize daily recreational boxes that family members and caregivers can use to stimulate
                patients for a positive outcome.</p>
