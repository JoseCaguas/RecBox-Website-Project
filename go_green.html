        <h2>Go Green for Alzheimer's</h2>
        <h3>Written by Tina Antonucci</h3></p>


        <div>

            <p>When we think of recycling we don’t often think about Alzheimer’s disease. But by the time you are done
                reading this article you will see the clear connection between the two.</p>
            <p> According to the National Alzheimer’s Association an estimated 5.3 million Americans are living with
                Alzheimer’s disease in 2015. This number is growing rapidly and the Association believes that by the
                year 2025 this number can increase to over 7 million. By 2050 the number is set to triple unless of
                course a cure is found. As of now there is NO cure for this disease. Alzheimer’s disease is a disease
                of losses. The first loss is memory. As changes in the brain occur cognitive loss increases and
                eventually leads to more severe dementia symptoms including disorientation, mood changes, and deep
                confusion, to name a few. The Alzheimer’s Association states that once symptoms are noticed a person
                lives an average of 8 years. But some cases can vary depending on other health conditions and can range
                from 4 to 20 years. While there is no cure there are some things we can do to help alleviate and reduce
                some of the dementia symptoms.</p>
            <p>Sensory stimulation is a therapeutic intervention used by therapists around the world that
                incorporates the use of everyday items to arouse one of more of the five senses. It was developed
                in Europe in the 1960’s originally to help children with neurological disorders. But when effects
                of this therapy have been proven to help reduce the negative symptoms of dementia and increase
                positive behaviors it is gaining popularity among interventions for Alzheimer’s disease. A
                Norwegian research study showed that adults with dementia that engaged in sensory stimulation
                activities improved alertness and reduced agitation.</p>
            <p>Sensory stimulation can be as simple as sniffing a familiar smell, to touching a unique sensory
                board. You can collect a group of items together and create a personalized sensory touch box. Themed
                touch
                boxes provide tactile stimulation and provoke communication through the use of familiar items. People
                living with Alzheimer’s and Dementia often lose the ability to communicate as the disease progresses.
                Using
                familiar items to recall positive memories often makes the person living with this disease feel
                meaningful again.</p>
            <p>So where do we get these “items” to be used in creating these sensory boxes or boards? Well that is
                where the recycling comes in. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency or EDA in
                2010
                Americans produced 250 million tons of Municipal Solid Waste. Municipal Solid Waste or MSW consists of
                everyday items that we call garbage like furniture, newspaper, plastic packaging, bottles, paint,
                appliances, food scraps and batteries to name a few. Recycling is the recovery of these items to
                create new items and ultimately reduce waste. The EDA reported 85 million tons of waste was
                recycled in 2010. While that is great I believe we can do better. Bottles are a great tool for
                sensory stimulation therapies. “Look and find” bottles can be created using a recycled bottle,
                filled with beans and small items for the person to look for. The beans add an auditory stimulation
                that can be quite relaxing. You can use a recycled egg carton to create a “texture tactile match”
                game. Filling the little egg crates with pairs of different textures to explore is a great sensory
                experience. You can also use recycled materials to fill the crates. For example I used scraps of
                bubble wrap, textured paper, recycled fabrics, sand paper, and even recycled cork. You then gently
                place the person’s finger over one texture and ask them to find the match.</p>
            <p>While there are numerous sensory items on the market that you can purchase, you get the same
                therapeutic outcome using the recycled version. Using recycled materials to create sensory items for
                people living with Alzheimer’s and Dementia is not only saving the earth but giving you the opportunity
                to make the item personal. So for instance if your loved one was an avid golf player you might want to
                hide some colored golf tee’s in your look and find bottle. Another great sensory game using recycled
                materials is a picture word match game that can be created using recycled caps, old magazines and/or
                newspapers, a recycled shirt box or paper, and a black sharpie marker. I prefer Gatorade caps
                but if that is too small you can use mayonnaise caps or a larger cap of some kind. Trace the
                cap onto the paper or box as many times as it will fit. Next you must find relatable items that
                you can paste onto the outside of the lids (creating a game piece.) Write the word that is on the
                game piece in the traced circle on the shirt box or paper (I prefer the box because you can store
                the game pieces inside of it.) Now the person must match the picture with the word. You can also
                print out pictures of loved ones and write their names in the traced circles. The person with
                Alzheimer’s has to match a face with a name. This gives the game an added cognitive challenge
                that often is successful because the game pieces are personal. I worked with a lovely lady who
                had Alzheimer’s disease and had a very hard time engaging in activities. This game had her fully
                engaged for almost an hour every time she played it. She loved looking at the faces of her
                children and her grandchildren, there was even a picture of her in her twenties and she would
                stare at this piece, with a smile, the longest.</p>
            <p>This summer my book “The DIY Activity Dept.” will be published. Learn how to use recycled materials,
                neighborhood resources, and creativity, to provide personalized stimulating activities for people
                living with Dementia and Alzheimer’s. This book is a Do-It-Yourself guide for Activity Directors,
                Caregivers, Health Care Professionals, and anyone else who wants to provide someone with
                Alzheimer’s and Dementia with meaningful and purposeful activities.</p>
            <p>Until then you can read my posts at www.tinaantonucci.wordpress.com and visit me on Instagram
                @recbox for more creative ideas on how to use recycled materials to create sensory boxes for
                people living with this disease.</p>
